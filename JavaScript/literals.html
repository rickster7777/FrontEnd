<!--
    Literals are the fixed values.
    Variables are the values that can be changed.

    Identifiers can only start with a letter, underscore(_) or dollar sign($).

    Expressions
    An expression can combine numbers, strings and variables to output a value.
    Just like in math, expressions are evaluated from left to right when coding.
    var x=1;
    var y=3;
    var z=x+y;

    Here z is an expression which includes two variables and an operator.

    Comments
    //
    /*   */
    Note: Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

    Types of Camel Case
    1) Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
    FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

    2) Lower Camel Case:
    JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
    firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
